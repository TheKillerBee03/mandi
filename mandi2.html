<h1>Christmas Letter</h1>
<h3>Dear Mom,<br>
I just want  say thank you—for everything  and sacrifices you’ve made for me, and my biggest source of inspiration.</h3>

<h3>Thank you for always being there, no matter what. For your hugs when I needed comfort, and your patience even when I made mistakes. and I want you to know that I see it and cherish it deeply.</h3>

<h3>You’ve taught me the values of kindness, resilience, and hard work. I’m so lucky to have you as my mom, and I hope you know how much I love and appreciate you.</h3>

<h3>I promise to do my best to make you proud and to give back even just a fraction of the love and care you’ve given me. Thank you for being you—the most amazing mom anyone could ask for.</h3>

<h3>With all my love,<br>
mandi</h3>
